                <p>A former top-level freestyle snowboarding athlete, then manager of a family business employing around forty people, it was after searching for meaning in my various ventures that a break in my life took place in 2019. The time has come to "do for the others" and I'm focusing my new projects on discovery, hospitality, sharing and humanitarian aid.</p>
                <p>Over the past few years, I've made several trips to sensitive countries such as India and Nepal. I needed to be on the ground with NGOs, to understand their needs and appreciate the remarkable work they do.</p>
            </section>

            <div class="highlight">
                So I decided to create <strong>the REJOICE association in 2024 to provide financial support to NGOs abroad.</strong>
            </div>

            <p>Why abroad, you may ask, there are already so many needs in our Western countries...<br>
            What motivated my choice was the extreme urgency in which some of these organizations find themselves, fighting against a precariousness that is hard to imagine. To support children and the handicapped, who are in total destitution, abandoned by all.</p>

            <p>Please help us by making a one-off or regular donation to the association.<br>
            I personally pledge that every euro will be donated and used to support all these wonderful human projects.</p>
